# landing-page
This is the second project in The Odin Project's Foundational course. 
The task was to create a homepage from scratch with basic HTML and CSS (font, colors, margin/padding, and flexbox).
A template image was provided, but a creative flare was encouraged.

The influence behind this page was to create webpage for a physical training company.
The homepage will include non-functional links on the header and sign-up buttons, testimonals, and a motivational quote.
